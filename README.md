# image-classification
This project aims to develop a robust image classification model for a custom dataset combining Fashion-MNIST and Japanese Integers datasets, employing deep learning techniques with the ResNet-50 architecture. The dataset consists of grayscale images of size 28x28 representing objects from 10 classes, and the task is to accurately identify the class of the object present in each image.
